# TPV_TEA

Data and code for [Thermophotovoltaic performance metrics and techno-economics: Efficiency vs. power density](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125479).

We have also built a [TPV Simulator](https://sites.mit.edu/tpvsim/) based on the code here, which allows you to predict efficiency and power density of a cell given cell properties, and then predict LCOE given cost inputs.
